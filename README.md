# The Goodness Network

Welcome to our humble project!!

The goodness network is a webapp intended to help those in need and promote helping others. On itself the goodness network is a webapp which helps those who are good to quantify the goodness they have done. This is important as reputation and help are essential to the networks purpose. The network's purpose is to provide a community of people who help others periodically, this help will help the good ones, those who have helped when they need it.

This is achieved through a system of help requests, goodness coins and ranking.
- When one helps, he receives goodness coins
  *help a lot and get lots of coins*
- If he needs help he can spend this goodness coins to request help
  *If you help you will always find help*
- Unspent goodness coins, define the goodness reputation. As goodness reputation increases, ranking can be changed. More ranking means more decision making responsabilities over the community, more impact.
  *If you help a lot, not receiving anything in exchange, you are a great person and we can trust your judgement*

Reputation is important for certain help requests, you need to really trust a person.
Reputation helps us decide who should regulate and decide upon the network's rules
Goodness coins are money made of good actions
Help requests is the way we contribute to others and help the world become a better place 

The goodness network tries to be:
- A community of good people
- A support network for good people
- A help post portal for good people
- A promotor of goodness
